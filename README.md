​🔭 Convex Lens Simulation with Ray Tracing





​A JavaFX application designed to simulate how light rays interact with a convex lens using fundamental principles of geometric optics. This project demonstrates ray tracing, refraction via Snell's Law, and the generation of a visual spot diagram.


​🎯 Project Objective
​The goal of this simulation is to provide a valuable educational tool for optics and physics.It allows users to visualize and understand the behavior of light rays as they pass through a convex lens, confirming theoretical principles with adjustable parameters.  


​✨ Features
​

Adjustable Parameters: Users can input the Focal Length and Aperture Diameter of the convex lens.  
​

Ray Tracing Simulation: Simulates light rays passing through the lens, showing the path of the incident and refracted rays.  
​

Physics-Based Refraction: Light rays are refracted according to Snell's Law as they pass through the lens.  
​

Spot Diagram Generation: Creates a graphical representation (ScatterChart) showing the convergence point of the refracted rays, which is essential for understanding lens behavior and aberrations.  
​

JavaFX GUI: Built using JavaFX for a robust graphical user interface.
